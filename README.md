Estimating Distribution Parameters
===============

Districts 
----------------------------

In the US, our legislature is made up of representatives of individual
*districts* (unlike proportional representation systems).  Your task
is to characterize districts in "Red" Republican states vs. districts
in "Blue" Democratic states.

First, you'll need to extract the Republican share of the vote in a
district.  Then, you will need to compute the parameters of a Gaussian
distribution, then compute the probability of an observation given
those parameters.

Words Presidents Use 
-------------------------------

Each year, the president of the United States is required to make a
speech to congress describing the "State of the Union".  We are going
to create a simple *bigram language model* with *add one (Laplace)*
smoothing.  Your task is to characterize Republican vs. Democrat
presidents based on their speech.
